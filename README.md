# ModelAgnosticMetaLearning
This is a repository that contains a ,ipynb file that implements MAML (Model Agnostic Meta Learning) on the CUB-200 dataset. MAML is used in Few Shot Learning scenarios where we want to classify images from classes that do not have a sufficient number of samples. So we cannot train and evaluate the model (CNN) in the traditional way.
