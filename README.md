# ModelAgnosticMetaLearning
This is a repository that contains a ,ipynb file that implements MAML (Model Agnostic Meta Learning) on the CUB-200 dataset. MAML is used in Few Shot Learning scenarios where we want to classify images from classes that do not have a sufficient number of samples. So we cannot train and evaluate the model (CNN) in the traditional way. Instead , we create episodes from our training data ( every episode is a small classification task with support and query samples from a finite number of classes wich in our case is 5) and train the model using the episodes.The model ( in our case a simple CNN like ResNet) is trained using the inner and outer loop . The inner loop uses the support samples and the weight updates are temporary . With the temporary weights we calculate the loss of the query samples and apply the actual weight updates to the model . This is the outer loop . Essentially we are trying to configure the model so that it can adapt quickly to any task with a small number of samples. Our training dataset contains 60 classes and each episode contains samples from 5 classes , so the model sees a diverse dataset during training. This improves generalization . In this code , i used the CUB-200 dataset for training and evaluation in 5 way - 1 shot and 5 way - 5 shot episodes. The classes of the training and testing datasets do not overlap as we want to increase the generalization ability of the model and evaluate the accuracy on data it has not seen during training.You can change the configuration of every episode inside the code.
1.Download the dataset from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/18Ri71ZPUu5FY12AqejrI9_DWy4ywahRv/view?usp=drive_link . 2.Upload the .rar file to your Google Drive in the /MyDrive/ folder.
The .ipynb uses mounting so when you upload the dataset in your Google Drive you can start executing the code.
